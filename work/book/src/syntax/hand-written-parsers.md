# Hand-Written Parsers

The following chapters cover more advanced topics, providing an in-depth
exploration of the anatomy of Lady Deirdre's parsers. They will guide you on how
to override parsers generated by the Node macro with manually implemented parse
functions.

One common case where you might want to implement the parse procedure manually
is infix expression parsing. Infix expressions usually require left recursion,
which cannot be directly expressed in terms of LL(1) grammars.

These chapters will guide you through
the [Expr Parser](https://github.com/Eliah-Lakhin/lady-deirdre/tree/1f4ecdac2a1d8c73e6d94909fb0c7fcd04d31fc0/work/crates/examples/src/expr_parser)
example. This example demonstrates how to parse boolean expressions
(e.g., `(true | false) & true`) using the Pratt algorithm.
