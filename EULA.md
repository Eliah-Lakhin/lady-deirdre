# General License Agreement

This General License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legal document detailing
your rights and obligations related to the use of my proprietary computer
software work (the "Work").

By downloading or using this Work, you agree to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement, and this Agreement will be effective upon the first of those events
to occur.

If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not use
this Work.

"I", "me", or "my" refers to Ilya Lakhin (Илья Александрович Лахин in Russian),
the exclusive copyright holder of the Work responsible for providing this Work
to you under the terms of this Agreement.

"You" or "your" refers to an individual or a legal entity exercising
permissions granted by this Agreement.

## The Work

This Agreement licenses the work called "Lady Deirdre", a computer software
technology made for the development of programming languages source code
analysis, compilation, translation, and interpretation software. This technology
has a number of applications, including (but not limited to) the development
of programming language compilers, script language interpreters, live coding
systems, source code editors software, extensions for third-party integrated
development environments, and code editors.

The Work consists of a set of source code files, documentation files,
example files, compilation scripts, and related content files. As a whole,
this Work represents a set of computer software tools and compilable modules
with application programming interfaces (APIs) intended for integration into
third-party end software products.

This Work was created and published worldwide by me through the GitHub public
repository in 2022:

https://github.com/Eliah-Lakhin/lady-deirdre

The Work licensed to you under this Agreement includes the aforementioned
published files that are copied to your computer, any future updates and
upgrades to this Work made available to you by me, and any versions of any of
the foregoing that you create under the Agreement.

## Personal Use

As long as you are not violating this Agreement or applicable law, you may use
this Work privately for any non-commercial purpose. For example, you may use
this Work to try Lady Deirdre technology, or for personal educational, training,
or research purposes.

"Private use" means personal use of the Work in such a way that you do not share
the Work, any part of it, or anything you make with it, with any third party.
This includes not distributing, sublicensing, or otherwise making the Work
available to third parties.

Personal use does not permit creating derivative works intended for distribution
or public display. Any modifications or contributions must comply with
the "Derivative Work" section of this Agreement.

## Derivative Works

By contributing to this Work, you agree to the following terms regarding
derivative works:

1. **Assignment of Rights**: You hereby assign to
   Ilya Lakhin (Илья Александрович Лахин) all rights, title, and interest in and
   to any derivative works you create based on the Work. This assignment is
   perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, and royalty-free.
2. **Rights Granted**: "Assign" means that, without any additional terms and
   conditions other than those set forth in this Agreement, you grant me a
   fully-paid, exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, sublicensable, and
   transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, create derivative works based on, modify, sell, offer to
   sell, and otherwise exploit your Derivative Work for all current and future
   methods and forms of exploitation in any country.
3. **Warranties**: You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights,
   including intellectual property rights, moral rights, and other personal
   rights, in the Derivative Work to grant me the rights described above.
   If any of the rights to be licensed to me cannot be licensed under applicable
   law, you hereby waive and agree not to assert any of those rights.
4. **Definition**: "Derivative Work" means a work that is based upon the Work or
   one or more preexisting works, such as a revision, modification, translation,
   abridgment, condensation, expansion, collection, compilation, or any other
   form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work
   consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
   modifications that, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship,
   shall be considered a "Derivative Work".
5. **Exceptions**: For the purposes of this Agreement, third-party works that
   remain separable from the Work, that use the application programming
   interfaces (APIs) of the Work only, and that do not copy, distribute,
   display, or sell the Work or any part of the Work to third parties in source
   or compiled form, shall not be considered "Derivative Work."
6. **Examples**: If you fork my public GitHub repository to make changes to
   the Work or if you submit a pull request to my GitHub repository with changes
   to the Work, you assign those changes to me. However, if you develop separate
   software that utilizes the Work solely through its APIs and without any
   modifications to the Work itself, this separate software is not considered a
   Derivative Work.

By contributing to this Work, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.

## Digital Content Distribution

You may distribute and display my Work in its entirety (i.e., not in parts) and
without modifications to third parties who have a legal right to receive copies
of the Work, provided that such distribution and display are free of charge to
me, free of charge to third parties, and do not impose any additional liability
on me with respect to third parties.

When you distribute and display the Work to third parties, you must ensure that
the third parties also receive the text of this Agreement or a link to this
Agreement on GitHub:

https://github.com/Eliah-Lakhin/lady-deirdre/blob/master/EULA.md

For example, GitHub or any other digital content distribution service that I use
to publish this Work or any updates and upgrades to the Work also receives
the right under this Agreement to distribute and display my Work without
modifications to their users.

## License Overview

This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions for two types of
licenses pertaining to the use of the Work:

1. **Commercial-Limited License**: Automatically granted under this Agreement
   for non-commercial and limited commercial use of the Work.
2. **Unrestricted Commercial License**: Available for separate acquisition and
   grants the right for full commercial use of the Work.

The specific terms and conditions governing each type of license are set forth
in the respective sections below.

## License Restrictions

Both the **Commercial-Limited License** and the
**Unrestricted Commercial License** are non-exclusive, non-transferable, and
non-sublicensable worldwide licenses that permit you to use my Work for the
purpose of developing products, services, and extensions (the "Products").

These permissions are subject to the following general restrictions:

1. You may not distribute, sublicense, or otherwise make my Work available to
   third parties in compiled and executable form as part of any of your
   Products, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.
2. You may only use my Work in your Products without modification to the source
   code files and related materials of the Work. Any modifications to my Work
   are governed by the "Derivative Works" section of this Agreement.
3. You may not include or incorporate my Work into your Products in parts,
   regardless of whether your Product uses a subset of the Work. The Work must
   be included in its entirety, or linked through a digital content distribution
   network to the Product as a whole without changes.
4. You may not extend or transfer any liability in relation to my Work to third
   parties under this Agreement.

## Grant of the Commercial-Limited License

I hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable
worldwide license, permitting you to use my Work for the development of your
Products, subject to the commercial limitations specified herein.

This license applies separately to each of your Products and does not limit
the number of Products you may develop using my Work.

**Commercial-Limited Use**: "Commercial-limited use" is defined as use wherein
the total gross revenue directly generated by your Product worldwide during its
entire lifecycle, irrespective of the recipient of such revenue, does not exceed
$200,000 United States Dollars (USD) or the equivalent amount in other
currencies, as determined by the exchange rate at the time of revenue
generation.

**Revenue Sources**: Revenue sources include, but are not limited to:

- Digital or retail sales of the Product,
- Revenue from paid subscriptions to the Product as a service,
- Donations and crowdfunding campaigns associated with the Product,
- Payments from third-party distributors or agents for distributing, selling, or
  offering the Product.

**Lifecycle**: For the purposes of this Agreement, "lifecycle" refers to
the period from the initial public release of the Product until the cessation of
all related activities, including sales and support.

The prevailing exchange rate to be used for currency conversion to USD shall be
the rate published by a generally accepted financial authority or institution at
the time the revenue is received. You are obligated to maintain accurate records
of all revenue and to provide such records upon request to verify compliance
with this commercial-limited use condition.

**Exceeding Revenue Limit**: If the total gross revenue of your Product exceeds
the specified limit of $200,000 USD and you have not acquired a Commercial
License in advance or otherwise obtained the right to use the Work for
commercial purposes, you will be notified of the breach. You will have a period
of 30 days from the date of notification to acquire an Unrestricted Commercial
License. If you fail to acquire an Unrestricted Commercial License within this
period, I reserve the right to impose appropriate penalties, including but not
limited to monetary penalties, for each calendar month that the revenue exceeds
the limit.

Failure to comply with these record-keeping requirements may result in immediate
termination of this license and additional legal action.

## Unrestricted Commercial License Rights and Obligations

An Unrestricted Commercial License is not automatically granted under this
Agreement. To obtain an Unrestricted Commercial License, you must acquire it
separately under the terms and conditions specified at the time of acquisition.
This Agreement governs the rights and obligations related to the commercial use
of the Work once the Unrestricted Commercial License is obtained.

The Unrestricted Commercial License applies to each Product that you develop
using my Work. For each Product, you must acquire a dedicated Unrestricted
Commercial License if you wish to use my Work for commercial purposes, exempt
from the commercial-limited use specified in the "Grant of the Commercial-Limited
License" section of this Agreement.

1. The Unrestricted Commercial License grants you the right to use my Work to
   develop a Product without the commercial limitations set forth in the
   "Grant of the Commercial-Limited License" section of this Agreement.
2. The license is subject to the general restrictions specified in the
   "License Restrictions" section of this Agreement.
3. The license is granted for a limited duration, which is specified at the time
   of acquisition.
4. During the term of the Unrestricted Commercial License, you are entitled to
   use my Work, including any updates and upgrades, to develop your Product as
   expressly permitted by this Agreement. This right encompasses all activities
   related to the Product lifecycle, including but not limited to the Product
   support.
5. Upon the expiration of the Unrestricted Commercial License, your right to use
   my Work continues in perpetuity within the existing copy of the Work that you
   had access to at the time of expiration. However, you shall not be permitted
   to use any new versions, updates, upgrades, or modifications of my Work in
   your Product.
6. Should you acquire a new Unrestricted Commercial License, this new license
   will renew your right to use new versions, updates, upgrades, and
   modifications of my Work in your Product until the expiration of the new
   license.

Please be advised that obtaining an Unrestricted Commercial License does not
automatically confer the right to renew the license under the same terms and
conditions. I reserve the right to alter the terms and conditions applicable to
new Unrestricted Commercial Licenses and to cease offering new Unrestricted
Commercial Licenses at my sole discretion.

Furthermore, this Agreement does not impose any obligation on me to develop or
release new versions or upgrades of the Work.

## Warranty Disclaimer

**To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Work is provided
"as is" and "as available", without any warranties or conditions of any kind,
either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and
non-infringement.**

## Limited Liability

**In no event shall I be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,
exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement
of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business
interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in
contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising
in any way out of the use of the Work, even if advised of the possibility
of such damage.**

## Third Party Software

By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge and accept the license terms
of any third-party software incorporated into the Work, which shall take
precedence over any inconsistencies with the terms of this Agreement. You agree
that the owners of the third-party software are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this Agreement concerning your use of the third-party software
incorporated into the Work.

When you create a Derivative Work, make any contribution to the Work, or
otherwise use the Work in source or compiled form, you are not permitted (and
you may not permit others) to include, incorporate, combine, or mix any
third-party software or parts thereof in source or compiled form that would
directly or indirectly require that all or part of the Work be governed under
any terms other than those of this Agreement.

Specifically, you may not incorporate any third-party software licensed under
the GNU General Public License (GPL) into the Work.

This Agreement does not impose any liability on me for your failure to comply
with the license terms of third-party software.

## Amendments and Termination

I reserve the right to modify, amend, or replace the terms of this Agreement, or
to discontinue offering the Work to the public without providing a substitute.
Any such modifications, amendments, or replacements will become effective 30
days after being posted publicly or otherwise communicated to you.

Your continued use of the Work following the posting or communication of any
changes constitutes your acceptance of those changes.

You are not obligated to accept any new terms or amendments. In such a case,
this Agreement will continue to govern your use of the Work you have already
accessed under the original terms. However, if you do not accept the new terms
or amendments, you will not be permitted to use any new versions, updates,
upgrades, or modifications to the Work.

## No Obligation for Updates

This Agreement does not impose any obligation on me to create new versions or
upgrades to the Work, or to make any versions or upgrades available for access
or download.

## Third Party Agreements

This Agreement does not supersede, amend, or otherwise affect any other
agreements you may have with me.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless me (Ilya Lakhin) from and
against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected
with your use of the Work or violation of this Agreement.

## Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a
court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect.
