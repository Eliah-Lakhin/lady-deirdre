systems, source code editors software, extensions for integrated development
environment software.

The Work consists of a set of source code files, documentation files,
example files, compilation scripts, and related content files. As a whole this
Work represents a set of computer software tools and compilable modules with
application programming interfaces to be integrated into the third party end
software products.

This Work was created and published worldwide by me through the GitHub public
