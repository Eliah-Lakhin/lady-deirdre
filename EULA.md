# General License Agreement

This General License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legal document detailing
your rights and obligations related to the use of my proprietary computer
software work (the "Work").

By downloading or using this Work, you agree to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement, and this Agreement will be effective upon the first of those events
to occur.

If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not use
this Work.

"I", "me", or "my" refers to Ilya Lakhin (Илья Александрович Лахин in Russian),
the exclusive copyright holder of the Work responsible for providing this Work
to you under the terms of this Agreement.

"You" or "your" refers to an individual or a legal entity exercising
permissions granted by this Agreement.

## The Work

This Agreement licenses the work called "Lady Deirdre", a computer software
technology made for the development of programming languages source code
analysis, compilation, translation, and interpretation software. This technology
has a number of applications, including (but not limited to) the development
of programming language compilers, script language interpreters, live coding
systems, source code editors software, extensions for third-party integrated
development environments, and code editors.

The Work comprises a set of source code files, documentation files, example
files, compilation scripts, and related content files. Collectively, these
components constitute a suite of software tools and compilable modules with
application programming interfaces (APIs) intended for integration into
third-party software products.

The Work was created and published worldwide by me through the GitHub public
repository in 2022:

https://github.com/Eliah-Lakhin/lady-deirdre

The Work licensed to you under this Agreement includes the aforementioned
published files that are copied to your computer, any future updates and
upgrades to this Work made available to you by me, and any versions of any of
the foregoing that you create under the Agreement.

## Personal Use

As long as you comply with this Agreement and applicable law, you are granted
the right to use the Work privately for any non-commercial purpose. This
includes, for example, using the Work to explore the Lady Deirdre software
infrastructure, or for personal, educational, training, or research purposes.

"Private use" refers to personal, individual use of the Work in a manner that
does not involve sharing the Work, any portion of it, or any products derived
from it with any third party. This restriction includes prohibiting the
distribution, sublicensing, or otherwise making the Work available to third
parties.

Personal use does not authorize the creation of derivative works intended for
distribution or public display. Any modifications or contributions must comply
with the "Contributions" section of this Agreement.

## Contributions

For the purpose of contributing to the Work, this Agreement grants you the right
to create derivative works based on the Work, provided that you agree to grant
me an exclusive license to your derivative works, subject to the following terms:

1. **Definition**: A "Derivative Work" means any work based on the Work or one
   or more preexisting works, such as a revision, modification, translation,
   abridgment, condensation, expansion, collection, compilation, or any other
   form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work that
   includes editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
   modifications that, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is
   considered a "Derivative Work".
2. **Exceptions**: For the purposes of this Agreement, third-party works that
   remain separable from the Work, that interact with the Work only through
   its application programming interfaces (APIs), and that do not involve
   copying, distributing, displaying, or selling the Work or any part of it in
   source form, shall not be considered a "Derivative Work".
3. **Grant of Exclusive License**: Without any additional terms or conditions
   other than those set forth in this Agreement, you hereby grant to
   Ilya Lakhin (Илья Александрович Лахин) a fully-paid exclusive, irrevocable,
   perpetual, sublicensable, and transferable worldwide license to any
   Derivative Work made by you, to use, reproduce, distribute, publicly display,
   publicly perform, create derivative works based on, modify, sell, offer to
   sell, and otherwise exploit your Derivative Work for all current and future
   methods and forms of exploitation, in any jurisdiction.
4. **Warranties**: You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights,
   including intellectual property rights, moral rights, and other personal
   rights in the Derivative Work, to grant me the rights described above.
   If any of the rights to be licensed to me cannot be licensed under applicable
   law, you hereby waive such rights and agree not to assert them.
5. **Examples**: If you fork my public GitHub repository to modify the Work or
   submit a pull request to my GitHub repository with changes to the Work, you
   grant me an exclusive license to those changes. However, if you develop
   independent software that interacts with the Work solely through its APIs and
   without modifying the Work itself, this independent software is not
   considered a Derivative Work.

By contributing to this Work, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.

## Digital Content Distribution

You are permitted to distribute and display the Work in its entirety
(i.e., not in parts) and without modifications to third parties who are legally
entitled to receive copies of the Work, provided that such distribution and
display are free of charge to me, free of charge to third parties, and do not
impose any additional liability on me with respect to third parties.

When distributing and displaying the Work to third parties, you must ensure that
the third parties also receive the full text of this Agreement or a link to this
Agreement on GitHub:

https://github.com/Eliah-Lakhin/lady-deirdre/blob/master/EULA.md

For example, GitHub or any other digital content distribution service that I use
to publish this Work, or any updates and upgrades to the Work, also receives the
right under this Agreement to distribute and display the Work without
modifications to their users.

## Product Licenses Overview

This Agreement defines the terms and conditions for two types of non-exclusive,
non-transferable, and non-sublicensable worldwide licenses governing the use of
the Work for the purpose of developing Products (the "Product Licenses"):

1. **Basic Commercial License**: Automatically granted under this Agreement
   for non-commercial and limited commercial use of the Work.
2. **Full Commercial License**: Available for separate acquisition and grants
   the right for full commercial use of the Work.

**Product**: A "Product" is defined as any software product, service, API
extension, or any other project that incorporates the Work in source or compiled
form, or links to the Work through its application programming interfaces (APIs).

The specific terms and conditions governing each type of license are set forth
in the respective sections below.

## Product Licenses Restrictions

The Product Licenses are subject to the following general restrictions:

1. **Permitted Use**: You may not distribute, sublicense, or otherwise make the
   Work available to third parties in compiled or executable form as part of any
   of your Products, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.
2. **Use Without Modifications**: You may only use the Work in your Products
   without modifying the source code files or related materials.
   Any modifications to the Work are governed by the "Contributions" section of
   this Agreement.
3. **Use in Entirety**: You may not include or incorporate the Work into your
   Products in parts, regardless of whether your Product uses only a subset of
   the Work. The Work must be included in its entirety or linked through a
   digital content distribution network to the Product as a whole without
   modifications.
4. **Limited Liability**: You may not extend or transfer any liability related
   to the Work to third parties under this Agreement.

## Permitted Uses and Clarifications

This section provides clarifications regarding specific but not mutually
exclusive scenarios for using the Work in Products:

1. **Combined Compilation**: You are permitted to compile the Work with any
   other code or content into a single combined executable of the Product.
2. **Products in Source Form**: You are permitted to develop Products intended
   for distribution in source code form, provided that the terms of distribution
   and use of the Product in source code form do not include the Work. Users of
   the Product distributed in source code form must obtain a separate license
   for the Work from me, independent of the Product's terms governing the
   distribution and use of the Product.

As between you and me, you own all rights in the Products you develop under the
permissions granted by the Product Licenses, other than the rights in the Work.

As long as you comply with the terms of using the Work in the Product without
modifications, such Product is exempt from the requirement of providing an
exclusive license to me as set forth in the "Contributions" section of this
Agreement.

## Grant of the Basic Commercial License

I hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable
worldwide license to use the Work for the development of your Products, subject
to the commercial limitations specified herein.

This license applies separately to each of your Products and does not limit the
number of Products you may develop using the Work.

**Commercial-Limited Use**: "Commercial-limited use" is defined as use wherein
the total gross revenue directly generated by your Product worldwide during its
entire lifecycle, irrespective of the recipient of such revenue, does not exceed
$200,000 United States Dollars (USD) or the equivalent amount in other
currencies, as determined by the exchange rate at the time of revenue
generation.

**Revenue Sources**: Revenue sources include, but are not limited to:

- Digital or retail sales of the Product;
- Revenue from paid subscriptions to the Product as a service;
- Donations and crowdfunding campaigns associated with the Product;
- Payments from third-party distributors or agents for distributing, selling, or
  offering the Product.

**Lifecycle**: For the purposes of this Agreement, lifecycle refers to the
period from the initial public release of the Product until the cessation of all
related activities, including sales and support.

The prevailing exchange rate to be used for currency conversion to USD shall be
the rate published by a generally accepted financial authority or institution at
the time the revenue is received. You are required to maintain accurate records
of all revenue and to provide such records upon request to verify compliance
with this commercial-limited use condition.

**Exceeding Revenue Limit**: If the total gross revenue of your Product exceeds
the specified limit of $200,000 USD and you have not acquired a Full Commercial
License in advance or otherwise obtained the right to use the Work for commercial
purposes without the specified commercial limitations, you will be in breach of
this Agreement. You are required to immediately acquire a Full Commercial
License to continue using the Work for commercial purposes. If you do not do so
within 30 days, I reserve the right to impose appropriate penalties, including
but not limited to monetary penalties, for each calendar month that the revenue
exceeds the limit, regardless of whether or not you have been formally notified
of the breach.

Failure to comply with the record-keeping requirements may result in the
immediate termination of this license and additional legal action.

## Full Commercial License Rights and Obligations

A Full Commercial License is not automatically granted under this
Agreement. To obtain a Full Commercial License, you must acquire it
separately under the terms and conditions specified at the time of acquisition.
This Agreement governs the rights and obligations related to the commercial use
of the Work once the Full Commercial License is obtained.

The Full Commercial License applies to each Product that you develop
using the Work. For each Product, you must acquire a dedicated Full
Commercial License if you wish to use the Work for commercial purposes, exempt
from the commercial-limited use specified in the "Grant of the Basic Commercial
License" section of this Agreement.

1. **Exemption from Commercial Limitations**: The Full Commercial License grants
   you the right to use the Work to develop a Product without the commercial
   limitations set forth in the "Grant of the Basic Commercial License" section
   of this Agreement.
2. **General Restrictions**: The Full Commercial License is subject to
   the general restrictions specified in the "Product Licenses Restrictions"
   section of this Agreement.
3. **Time-Limited License**: The Full Commercial License is granted for
   a specified duration, as indicated at the time of acquisition.
4. **Updates and Upgrades**: During the term of the Full Commercial License,
   you are entitled to use the Work, including any updates and upgrades, to
   develop your Product as expressly permitted by this Agreement.
   This right encompasses all activities related to the Product lifecycle,
   including but not limited to Product support.
5. **License Expiration**: Upon the expiration of the Full Commercial License,
   your right to use the Work continues in perpetuity within the existing copy
   of the Work that you had access to at the time of expiration. However, you
   are not permitted to use any new versions, updates, upgrades, or
   modifications of the Work in your Product following the expiration of the
   license.
6. **License Renewal**: Should you acquire a new Full Commercial License, this
   new license will renew your right to use new versions, updates, upgrades,
   and modifications of the Work in your Product until the expiration
   of the new license.

Please be advised that obtaining a Full Commercial License does not
automatically confer the right to renew the license under the same terms and
conditions. I reserve the right to alter the terms and conditions applicable to
new Full Commercial Licenses and to cease offering new Full Commercial Licenses
at my sole discretion.

Furthermore, this Agreement does not impose any obligation on me to develop or
release new versions, updates, or upgrades of the Work.

## Warranty Disclaimer

**To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Work is provided
"as is" and "as available", without any warranties or conditions of any kind,
either express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.**

## Limited Liability

**In no event shall I be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,
exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement
of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business
interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in
contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising
in any way out of the use of the Work, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
even if advised of the possibility of such damage.**

## Third-Party Software

By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge and accept the license terms of
any third-party software incorporated into the Work. These third-party license
terms shall take precedence over any inconsistencies with the terms of this
Agreement. You agree that the owners of the third-party software are intended
third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement with respect to your use of the
third-party software incorporated into the Work.

When making a contribution to the Work, or otherwise using the Work in source or
compiled form, you are not permitted (and you may not permit others) to include,
incorporate, combine, or mix any third-party software or parts thereof, in
source or compiled form, that would directly or indirectly require that all or
part of the Work be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement.

Specifically, you may not incorporate any third-party software licensed under
the GNU General Public License (GPL) into the Work.

This Agreement does not impose any liability on me for your failure to comply
with the license terms of third-party software.

## Amendments and Termination

I reserve the right to modify, amend, or replace the terms of this Agreement, or
to discontinue offering the Work to the public without providing a substitute.
Any such modifications, amendments, or replacements will become effective 30
days after being posted publicly or otherwise communicated to you.

Your continued use of the Work following the posting or communication of any
changes constitutes your acceptance of those changes.

You are not obligated to accept any new terms or amendments. In such a case,
this Agreement will continue to govern your use of the Work you have already
accessed under the original terms. However, if you do not accept the new terms
or amendments, you will not be permitted to use any new versions, updates,
upgrades, or modifications of the Work.

## No Obligation for Updates

This Agreement does not impose any obligation on me to create, develop, or
release new versions, upgrades, or modifications to the Work, or to make any
such versions, upgrades, or modifications available for access or download.

## Additional Agreements

This Agreement does not supersede, amend, or otherwise affect any other
agreements that you may have with me regarding the Work.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless me, Ilya Lakhin, from and
against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out
of or in any way connected with your use of the Work or violation of
this Agreement.

## Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
